### Installation on YunoHost

- Firefly III requires a **dedicated (sub)domain** (must install under web root like **https://firefly.example.com/** not **https://example.com/firefly/** )

#### Register a new domain and add it to YunoHost

Firefly III requires a dedicated (sub)domain, so obtain one and add it using the YunoHost admin panel. **Domains -> Add domain**. As Firefly III uses the full domain and is installed on the root, you can create a subdomain such as firefly.domain.tld. Don't forget to update your DNS if you manage them manually.
 
#### Install the Firefly III application

Use the YunoHost admin panel to install Firefly III by entering the GitHub repo address in the custom app URL:

```
https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/firefly-iii_ynh
```

Or use the command line to install the Firefly III app:

```    
$ yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/firefly-iii_ynh
```

- The admin user should be a registered YunoHost user.
- Important: when the installation is complete, you will have to visit the domain on which the app is installed and register the first account with the **primary email address of the Admin user given at the time of installayion** (otherwise you will not get admin rights). The registration will lock itself after the first registration.
